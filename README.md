# AI Model Governance & FinTech ML Toolkit

An open-source toolkit for ensuring transparency, fairness, and compliance in fintech AI/ML models.

## Overview

This toolkit provides essential components for AI model governance in financial applications, focusing on:
- Model explainability using SHAP/LIME
- Bias detection and fairness metrics
- Automated report generation for compliance

## Features

### Phase 1
1. **Explainability Engine**
   - SHAP-based feature importance analysis
   - Local and global explanations
   - Interactive visualizations

2. **Bias Detection Module** (Coming Soon)
   - Demographic parity metrics
   - Disparate impact analysis
   - Fairness visualization

3. **Report Generator** (Coming Soon)
   - PDF/Markdown report generation
   - Compliance documentation
   - Risk assessment summaries

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from explainability.shap_explainer import ModelExplainer

# Initialize explainer
explainer = ModelExplainer(model, X_train)

# Get feature importance
importance = explainer.get_feature_importance()

# Generate local explanations
local_explanation = explainer.explain_prediction(sample)
```
